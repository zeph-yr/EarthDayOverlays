Hihi there!

Thank you so much for joining us in the fight for our future. The fight for climate action is not only for ourselves, but all life on Earth and those to come, human or not.

What started as a few lines of C# and a 3AM chat became a mission to unite the entire Beat Saber community to encourage hope and action for our climate. 

We want each person to know they can make a difference. Each of your efforts is valuable. When it comes to getting others to care, it only takes teaching one person who might go onto to inspire others to reach many. And we never know who that person may be or how many of them there are.

This pack contains a mix of banners and calls-to-action in tones ranging from funny to the spicer side. Examples are on github, though be creative and use them however you like. The list of bot-messages can be used in your stream chat to point viewers to resources where they can learn more and get involved.

Feel free to use these materials in your stream, discord server, social media and to share with friends and groups whom you think would use them for good and help the cause. When sharing these materials, we ask you to include this document along with the original zip contents.

This is a critical time for humanity. Our planet's future needs all the help it can get. Now is the time to show what we can do as a community. We **can** do this together.

With deepest gratitude,
Zeph & Jose/hitmewmusic + the BOOMR Clan

PS. Remember to win the true battle, we need lasting change. Get involved with efforts in your city & country and continue the fight.
