# üåè EarthDay Overlays ü¶ç

**Hello there!**

**Thank you so much for joining us in the fight for our future. The fight for climate action is not only for ourselves, but all life on Earth and those to come, human or not.**

What started as a few lines of C# and a 3AM chat became a mission to unite the entire Beat Saber community to encourage hope and action for our climate. 

**We want each person to know they can make a difference. Every single one of your efforts is valuable.** When it comes to getting others to care, it only takes teaching one person who might go onto to inspire others to reach many. And we never know who that person may be or how many of them there are.

**This is a critical time for humanity. Our planet's future needs all the help it can get. Now's the time to show what we can do as a community. We can do this together.** ‚ù§Ô∏è

<i>With deepest gratitude,</i><br>
<i>Zeph & hitmewmusic + the BOOMR Clan</i><br><br>
_PS. Remember to win the true battle, we need lasting change. Get involved with efforts in your city & country and continue the fight._
