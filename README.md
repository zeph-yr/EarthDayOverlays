# EarthDay Overlays

Hihi my friend!

Thank you so much for joining us in the fight for our future. We fight not only for ourselves, but for all life on Earth and those to come, human or not.

What started as a few lines of C# and a 3AM chat became a mission to unite the entire Beat Saber community to encourage hope and action for our climate. 

We want each person to know they can make a difference. Every single one of your efforts is valuable. When it comes to getting others to care, it only takes teaching one person who might go onto to inspire others to reach many. And we never know who that person may be or how many of them there are.

This is a critical time for humanity. Our planet's future needs all the help it can get. Now's the time to show what we can do as a community. We can do this together.


## How To Use
This pack is designed so each banner has one or more "matching" call-to-actions and works with any of the action-plans. Tone ranges from neutral to the spicier side. The elements flow best when their tones match, however feel free to pick what resonates with you and your audience. The bot-messages can be used in your stream chat to point viewers to resources where they can learn more and get involved.

Feel free to use these in your stream, discord servers, social media and to share with anyone or group whom you think would use them for good and help the cause. When sharing these materials, we ask you to include this document along with all the contents of the original zip.
