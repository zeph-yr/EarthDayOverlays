Hihi my friend!

Thank you so much for joining us in the fight for our future. We fight not only for ourselves, but for all life on Earth and those to come, human or not.

What started out as a few lines of C# be has turned into a mission to unite the entire Beat Saber community to encourage hope and action for our climate. 

We want each person to know they can make a difference. Every single one of your efforts is valuable. When it comes to getting others to care, it only takes teaching one person who might go onto to inspire others to reach many. And we never know who that person may be or how many of them there are.

For context, this pack is designed such that each banner has one or more "matching" call-to-actions and works with any of the action-plans. There are serveral tones from neutral to the more raw side. The elements flow best when the tones match, however feel free to pick what resonates with you and your audience.

Feel free to use these in your stream, on your discord servers, social media and to share with anyone or group whom you think would use them for good and help the cause. If you share these materials, we ask you to include this document and all the contents of the original zip.

This is a critical time for humanity. Our planet's future needs all the help it can get. Now's the time to show what we can do as a community. We *can* do this together.

With deepest grattitude,
Zeph & <how do you want to sign?> on behalf of BOOMR Clan
